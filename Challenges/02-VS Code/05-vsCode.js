"Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We need dark in order to show light. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. In life you need colors. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. That's crazy. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

You need the dark in order to show the light. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

Let's do it again then, what the heck. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Son of a gun. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Anything you want to do you can do here. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Those great big fluffy clouds. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Learn when to stop. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Just make little strokes like that. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. I like to beat the brush. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Put it in, leave it alone. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You can get away with a lot. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. See there how easy that is. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. In life you need colors. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Use your imagination, let it go. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Put it in, leave it alone. We'll have a super time. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Every time you practice, you learn more. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. This piece of canvas is your world.

If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Working it up and down, back and forth. Let's do it again then, what the heck. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.

If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. The least little bit can do so much.

That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.";
